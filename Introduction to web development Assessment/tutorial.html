    <h4>
        Introduction
    </h4>
<P>
    The purpose of the tutorial page is to give an insight into a learning skill. The particular learning skill I have chosen to discuss and share is the approach of critical thinking.  
 
    Critical thinking is the use of analytical facts to form a strong judgement. This is a very important skill to have when writing essays as it can help prove points as well as produce rational and unbiased evidence. 
        I will explain the approaches of achieiving this skill with the following steps below. During these steps I will explain each step and then provide an image to help visualise the step. Throughout this tutorial each step will use a seperate mindmap which should create a big one at the end. For the purpose of this tutorial I will base my topic on "if alcohol should be illegal".

<div class ="step1">
<h4>
    Step 1
</h4>

<p>
    The first step to critical thinking is identifying the topic or the question you wish to be answered. After this the next approach is to find information regarding the topic and organise it by a category such as location of source or the time of release. The reason for this is that it helps for selecting and identifying appropriate information as well as structuring it. In terms of struture, creating a visulation of the information collected can provide a guide for indivduals to structure the information in such a way that reveals the connections between the main topic and the various themes or categories, an example can be a mind map as you can see on the right.

<div class ="step2">
<h4>
    Step 2
</h4>
<p>
    The next step is to provide supporting reasons for your view. Implementing this allows you to create a structural relationship between statements which enables you to further increase the support of your topic / question.  This is important as most people don’t support their response / statement and may confuse certain individuals. When used correctly it can highlight and separate key reasons and objectives. The best way to do so is to use a rationales reasoning map.

<div class ="step3">
<h4>
    Step 3
</h4>
<p>
    The third step to critical thinking is to gather and consider what evidence is necessary to use as well as how it will contribute to your topic / question. An important part of critical thinking is obtaining crucial evidence as this will help create a solid argument / statement for your topic or question. Using a rationale basis box allows you to identify the foundation of a statement. This will display the amount of research that you have utilised.

<div class ="step4">
<h4>
    Step 4
</h4>
<p>
    The next step is to analyse the statements and support you have found. The reason for this is it ensures that each statement is valid and reliable to use. Using the map, this allows you to identify assumptions a lot easier as well, providing clarity to create arguments with supportive and opposing statements.<br/><br/><br/>

<div class ="step5">
<h4>
    Step 5
</h4>
<p>
    The fifth step is evaluating the arguments from step four. This only works once you have a set of arguments for and against, once structured they will need to be evaluated with a rationale of the claims as well as evidence towards your topic / question. This is needed as it will help back your for and against statements for a stronger evaluation. Using the mind map you can separate these arguments into categories of the strength of the argument from strongest to weakest. This will help you communicate and improve the understanding of your conclusion. Using icons allows you to show the strength of the arguments.

<div class ="step6">
<h4>
    Step 6
</h4>
<p>
    The final step is to communicate your conclusion. Now you can put everything together to form one big mind map, this will help you write or speak your ideas. Having all statements that support or oppose your topic displayed will help structure your arguments. Using this along with your argument will help individuals visualise rationale and is a crucial feature ensure your audience is able to follow and understand.
