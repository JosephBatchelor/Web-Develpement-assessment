<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>
    The purpose of this web page is to provide an idea of the structure of the course as well as the procedures that are involved. This web page will give an insight into my development and progression through this course in regards to theory based work and practical based work (laboratory work).Whilst also providing my own personal opinions and thoughts about the course.

<h2>Evaluation and review  </h2>


<p>
    Within my evaluation and review I will be performing numerous tests to see the quality of my webpage. I will display an image to show proof of testing.

The first test is validating my HMTL. This is done to see if there’s any problems with my mark-up.  A good validation means that our webpages will respond and perform to the ideal stand, this also prevents any problems when introducing further code as well as when styling. Down below you can see that I have tested my pages and that I have no errors or warnings within my HMTL across all my webpages.
</p>

  <img class="image" src=" images/validtut.jpg " alt="Doctype visual" >
  
  <img class="image" src="images/validContact.jpg " alt="Doctype visual">
</div>
</figure>

<p>
    The second test is checking the CSS validation is correct. Same as the HTML validator, the CSS validator will check our stylesheets for any errors that may affect the presentation of our webpage. Down below you can see an image displaying my stylesheet being validated, which shows no errors have occurred.
</p>


<figure>
<div CLASS="imagecss">
<img class="image" src="images/CSSvalid.jpg " alt="Doctype visual">
</div>
</figure>
<p>
    Another test I performed was testing my webpages on a mobile device. This was to test my webpages responsive re-sizing. This may happen when shrinking the browser or accessing my page on another device. This was performed to test whether my webpage is responsive as well as if it's user friendly, this means whether it's functional and easy to use. Down below you can see how my webpage compresses when seen on mobile or the browser is resized.
</p>


<div class="googlemobile1">
<img src=" images/mobileveiw.jpg" alt="Doctype visual" class="image" >
</div>



<p>
    I performed a browser compatibility test which is where you emulate your webpages on different browsers with different version types. This was done to see the effects different browsers and versions have when using your webpage. From the test I achieved good results meaning that my webpage was able to use the modern version of popular browsers such as google chrome and Firefox. However old versions were unable to load my page, this could be a problem with my document as the browser may not support it. Overall I achieved goods results on common browser engines.
</p>
<p>
    Next, I performed a google mobile friendly test. This determined whether my webpages are user friendly when seen on a mobile device as well as to test if the functions work. Down below you can see an image stating that I have passed the test.
</p>

<div class="googlemobile">
<img class="image" src="images/googlemobile.jpg " alt="Doctype visual">
</div>


<p>
    The final test I performed was a colour contrast checker which determines whether your text is readable and identifiable. This will make sure that your webpage is readable to other users. Down below you can see what score I achieved.
</p>
<div class="contractimage">
<img class="image" src="images/contrast.jpg " alt="Doctype visual">
</div>
<br><br><br><br><br><br>
<p>
    Now I have performed all my tests I can confirm that my webpage is able to perform effectively across modern version browser as well as having the ability to work on mobile devices while also being user friendly. All the tests will be listed within the reference section for use.

<h2>Week 10: CSS positioned layout </h2>


<div class = "grid30">
<p>
We are now in our final week of web development and today we are looking at a more in-depth tutorial on positioning layout. This weeks lecture was covered by a guest speaker who has a strict but efficient approach to designing web pages. This lecture will cover the following areas which are listed to the right.
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong> CSS positioned layout </Strong></li>
<li><strong> Common uses  </Strong></li>
<li><strong>Week 10 laboratory work</strong></li>
<li><strong>Independent learning</strong></li>
<li><strong>Overall opinion of week 10</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>

<div class = "parallax"></div>
<div class = "information">
<h4> CSS positioned layout </h4>


<p>
To start off with this weeks lecture we will be looking into position properties. The main purpose of posistioned layouts is to remove elements and have the ability to place them anywhere on your webpage. This can be done by simply using some styling lines and values. Typically, without the thought or use of positioned layout types. Your webpage should be displayed within a normal flow layout, this means that inline elements are nested within block elements. However, CSS has allowed us to use different layouts which affects the elements within a HTML document. Listed below are some of the following CSS lines that can be used.
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong> Static – This is where elements are positioned in a normal flow layout. </Strong></li>
<li><strong> Relative - This removes the elements normal flow layout and allows you to place it anywhere on your page. </Strong></li>
<li><strong>Sticky – This holds an element in place which can allow users to scroll whilst having the element remain in place. </strong></li>
<li><strong>Absolute – Positions an element within a parent element. </strong></li>
<li><strong> Fixed – Almost the same as absolute, this removes the element and positions it in relation to the viewport. </strong></li>
</ul>




</div>


<div class = "parallax"></div>
<div class = "information">
<h4> Common uses</h4>
<p>
Now we will talk about the use of fixed position and sticky layout to give an understanding of how and where these can be used. These two layouts are commonly used and are often compared to one another, therefore it is necessary to explain their differences and uses.
<br/><br/>
<div class = "grid32">
<p>
    Although it is a relatively new feature to CSS, <strong>sticky layout</strong> has become increasingly popular. The purpose of this layout is to stick elements in place allowing the user to move freely around the webpage whilst maintaining the ability to still see that element. I have applied this feature to my navigation bar, meaning that when a user scrolls through my page the navigation bar follows them. Resulting in quick access to other pages or sections within the page itself. This  involves the use of scripts in-order for this to work however, this is a feature used in many other webpages to improve user experience.
</p>

<figure>
<img src=" images/stickylayout.png" alt="Doctype visual" class="image" >
</figure>
</div>

<br/><br/>
<div class = "grid32">
    <p>
Now to discuss <strong>fixed layout</strong>, this layout feature is used as default normal flow. Everything remains in place. An example of this being used within my learning journal has mainly been in the weekly content. All the information about lectures are within a fixed layout which means they remain still when scrolling through my webpage. Overall this means that the presentation will remain the same compared to that of fluid or flexible layouts.

<h4> Week 10 laboratory work </h4>
<p>
For this weeks laboratory work we will be implementing different CSS positioned layouts within our webpage. So far, I have already used fixed and absolute layouts within my page, I am working towards sticky layout which will be used to create a following navigation bar to help with the user experience. I will also attempt to implement relative layout, this will allow me to put elements around my webpage instead of using the normal flow format. A lot of webpages use these layouts as they either provide a user-friendly experience and are mainly used to help with the presentation of the webpage.
</P> 

</div>


<div class = "parallax"></div>
<div class = "information">
<h4> Independent learning </h4>
<P>
 My independent learning for week 10 involved me introducing a scrolling parallax as well adding responsive buttons that creates pop up’s and drop-down tabs once a button has been clicked.
Starting with the scrolling parallax effect which is a dynamic / changeable background that improves design and presentation. I have implemented this effect with the help of “Panagiotis” the guest speaker. He explained what makes a good site function as well as he showed a group of us online what can be used to help improve presentation and style of a webpage , the site he showed us was <a href=" https://www.creativebloq.com/web-design/parallax-scrolling-1131762" target="_blank">Creative Blog</a> .  One of the effects was parallax scrolling which had caught my eye. He provided us with a link to <a href=" https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_parallax.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> to implement this feature. As you can see if you scroll through my page you able to see the background images change. I have created a slide where you are able to see the images below with their links.

<h4> Overall opinion of week 10 </h4>
<p>
Learning the additional layouts within this weeks lecture were helpful however, implementing all the layouts within my web page seemed very unlikely. I have used three out of the five layouts so far and I can’t see myself using all of them within one page. This week has allowed me to introduce sticky layouts to create a navigation bar that follows the user when scrolling through my page, this allows for quick access to other resources.

<h2>Week 9: HTML5 and CSS forms </h2>
<div class = "grid29">
<p>
We are now on week 9 of web development. In this lecture we will look at implementing more tags and styles onto our tutorial page. The tutorial page is another webpage we have to design which will involve a step by step tutorial of a study skill which will then be further explained through both written and visual elements. We will also start to create a third webpage which at the moment is just a frontend web form for contacting me. However, our main focus for this week is listed to the right. 
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong> Role of forms on websites </Strong></li>

<div class = "information">
<h4> Role of forms on websites </h4>
<p>
Within this section we will be introducing web forms. A web form is essentially a section on a webpage or an independent webpage that allows users to interact, utilising the web form input as a means of obtaining data. Web forms have been largely used with commercial sites to obtain information from customers.
</p>
<p>
A web form is made up of three components; the front-end, the middleware and the back end. The front-end is where clients can access the form on a device, the front-end transfers the input data that the customer may have inserted which then travels through the middleware which links to software such as databases. Once travelled, the data is then placed in the back-end which is the data base / server where the data is held for later use.
</p>
<p>
We will only be making the front-end of the web form this semester, we will be starting the back-end in semester 2.
</p>

</div>

<div class = "parallax2"></div>
<div class = "information">
<h4> HTML form elements </h4>
<p>
    In this section we will be looking at the elements used within a webform,
when designing and presenting the form some new elements are introduced. They still adhere to the same rules of being nested correctly i.e. block elements can’t be placed within inline elements. 
</p>




</div>

<div class = "parallax2"></div>
<div class = "information">
<h4> Styling forms with CSS </h4>
<p>
This next section will be about styling the form, the same as you would with other webpages using a combination of attributes to fine tune the presentation of the form. Our form would be basic and will not need styling as this can affect certain form elements. However, we will use CSS to help display the layout and clarity to make it user friendly. We will also investigate how to make forms responsive in our own time. 
<br/><br/>
When styling / presenting it is always best to consider the user experience and ensure that people with different abilities can access these inputs.  An important user feature to consider is when users are accessing your web form on a touch screen device. The pixel touch needs to be considered as incorporating this effect can prevent miss clicks or the pixel touch covering two or more buttons at a time.
<br/><br/>
Another styling feature which is user friendly is introducing buttons, this is important as it indicates what is clickable for action. Having a little icon informs the user that this can be used to perform an action.
</p>

<h4> Week 9 laboratory work </h4>

<p>
This is the last week of laboratory work and we have been tasked with continuing the development of both the tutorial page and web form page. The tutorial page is simple it is just a web page that is based on a study skill we have previously learned. This can be anything in relation to studying such as revision tasks etc. It is to be presented differently to your learning journal whilst still using the same CSS style sheet.  
<br/><br/>
 The next task is to begin introducing a web form into the contact page. So far I have looked into it but have yet to implement it in my own webpage.
</p>

</div>


<div class = "parallax2"></div>
<div class = "information">
<h4> Independent learning </h4>
<P>
    In week 9 of independent work I have introduced a sticky navigation bar as well as created photos for my tutorial page. Starting with the navigation bar I have altered the appearance as well as the functionality. Originally, they were links arrayed within a list however, I have now place them within a class that is able to follow you as you scroll down. I have also implemented a drop down navigation bar which holds the links, this can be triggered if you hover over the weekly content or webpages. The way I found this out was due to a guest speaker (Panagiotis) who was able to give me insight on how to improve my webpage and suggested the sticky navigation bar. He also provided me with a link to <a href=" https://cpanel.brighton.domains/cpsess5614211097/frontend/paper_lantern/filemanager/editit.html?file=index.html&fileop=&dir=%2Fhome%2Fjb1828%2Fpublic_html%2Fmysite&dirop=&charset=&file_charset=utf-8&baseurl=&basedir=&edit=1" target="_blank">W3Schools</a> where I found the sticky navigation bar and drop down menu.
<br/><br/>
The photos I created was to help me explain my tutorial topic which is the approach to critical thinking. I provided self-created image’s about the topic to help user’s have a better understanding of the step by step tutorial. By using my navigation bar which should be on top of the screen you can switch to my tutorial page to see the image's I created.

<h4> Overall opinion of week 9 </h4>
<p>
I found this week interesting and exciting as we got to work on new areas of our web page as well as implementing new features which has already improved the user experience. I am very excited to continue working on both the tutorial and web form.

<h4> Basic layout properties </h4>
<P>
To start off this week's lecture we will be looking at the basic layout properties. The three main properties we will be looking at this week are <strong> float</strong>, <strong> clear </strong> and <strong> position </strong>. In the section below I will be explaining the three different properties.
</p>

<p>
<strong> Float </strong> - This property is designed to lay out text wrapped around images or videos. This was used to replace the normal way of text positioned below or above as explained previously. However here is an image to show how this can be done on a HTML document and CSS style sheet.

    As you can see we have created two classes one called <strong>“fltlt”</strong> and <strong>“clear”</strong>. The class <strong>“fltlt”</strong> can be styled to change an image in this case puppy.png.
    <br/><br/>
The other class <strong>“clear”</strong> doesn’t contain anything this is because we will be using it as an empty container which will then help us wrap the text around the image.
<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
As you can see the styling properties used for the <strong>“fltlt”</strong> is needed to move the image to the left side of the page. Alternatively, using the other line to move to the right side also works. The styling line used for the <strong>“clear”</strong> class is to keep it blank.

<h4> Layout modules </h4>

<div class = "grid26">
<p>
This section looks over layout modules which we have covered previously in past lectures. Within this lecture we will be introducing two more layout modules, these new modules are the last two listed on the right.
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong> CSS Grid layout </Strong></li>
<li><strong> Multi column layout </Strong></li>
<li><strong>Flexible box layout</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class = "grid27">
<p>
Starting off with flexbox which is a module that lays out the elements in the assorted rows and columns. In order to use the flexbox properly, it is as simple as adding a display line with value flex inside. As shown on the right there are two ways this can be done using <strong> flex</strong> and <strong>inline-flex</strong>. 

</p>
<img src=" images/flexcss.jpg" alt="Doctype visual" class="image" >
</div>
<p>
Flexbox allows users to perform all kinds of styling functions such as wrapping text around an image or video. The use of flexbox can implement different element layouts such the ability to lay an element horizontally. Overall flexbox is an efficient tool to use as it can help visualise styling layers of a webpage.
</p>
<br/><br/>
<div class = "grid28">
<p>
The next module that we will be looking at is the <strong>multi column layout</strong>. This is an efficient layout as it allows developers to take chunks of work and flow it across their webpage into different rows and columns. The multi column uses several styling properties to fine tune different aspects, the list of properties is listed below.
</p> 
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong> column-count – This is the number of columns</Strong></li>
<li><strong> column-width – Can style the width of the columns</Strong></li>
<li><strong> column-gap – Identifies the gap size between columns</strong></li>
<li><strong>column-span – Can identify that span across columns</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4> Hiding elements </h4>
<div class = “grid29”>
<p>
A new skill we learnt this week was how to hide elements within our learning journal. There are two ways this can be done, both methods involve styling the desired element using two separate CSS lines. 
<br/><br/>
The first approach is using the display CSS style. This is a simple way of hiding elements to do this follow the instructions below. 
</p>
<ol class = "OrderedLists">
<li > First step is choosing your desired element you wish to hide. This could range many inline and block tags.</li>
<li >  Next add your chosen element to your CSS stylesheet. </li>
<li >  Once added apply curly brackets to tell CSS you are about to style this element. </li>
<li >  Simply add the following line <strong> display: none;. </strong> </li>
<li >  Save and refresh your webpage and watch the effects change this should hide your element making it hidden on your webpage. </li>
</ol>

<h4> Week 8 laboratory work </h4>
<p>
This week’s laboratory tutorial consisted of testing / experimenting with the three layout modules which were explained across the following weeks. This meant we had to introduce some columns as well as try to wrap text using flexbox. We used multicolumn layout for more than one elements styling such as using it within my navigation and weekly contents class.

<h4> Independent learning </h4>
<div class = "grid15">
<p>
Independent learning for week 8 consisted of implementing a user-friendly feature, which is the process of enlarging images when hovered over with cursor. I introduced this feature to help people see the images presented as it helps for a better understanding of the point I’m trying to explain. I found out how to perform this from <a href="https://www.tutorialrepublic.com/faq/how-to-change-image-on-hover-with-css.php" target="_blank"> Tutorial Republic</a>. To the right you can see how I managed to do it.

<br/><br/>
I have also made a slideshow which I have planned to use when I introduce parralax scrolling so I can display the photos in a slideshow I will display an image to show how I managed to do it. I learnt how to do it from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_slideshow.asp" target="_blank">W3Schools</a>. Below you can see the HTML and CSS layout for creating a slide show.

<h4> Overall opinion of week 8 </h4>
<p>
I felt that this week was useful but also slightly overwhelming as trying to implement all the layout modules can be achieved however, it’s easier and better to put your focus towards one specific layout. Other than that I felt the use of multi-column layout was very useful, I have applied it successfully to my learning journal for extra easy styling.

<h4> Adding images   </h4>
<div class ="grid21">
<p>
The main section of this week is discussing how images should be viewed on our journal. The main thoughts to consider are the dimensions of the image, resolution and the size of the file when loaded. We later discussed what file size influences. 
<br/><br/>
    The picture to the right demonstrates the comparisons of different file sizes of the same image. As you can see, when the file size decreases so does the image quality however, this means that the lower the size of the file the faster it will be able to upload onto a browser. For a closer look hover your cursor over the image and it will enlarge.
</p>
<figure>
   <img src=" images/filesize.png" alt="Doctype visual" class="image3"  >
   </figure>
</div>

<div class = "grid22">
<p>
Using images on webpages is a good way to explain information while also providing a visualisation of what the developer means. When using images on a webpage, there are some features that need to be considered in order to achieve the best possible display. The most important aspects to consider to improve the picture quality of your images are listed to the right.
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong> High resolution </Strong></li>
<li><strong> Large pixel dimension </Strong></li>
<li><strong> Very large file </strong></li>
<li><strong> Slow to load </strong></li>
</ul>
</div>


<p>
There are two ways to insert images, using HTML or using CSS. Both can be used successfully but each option has different effects when applied.
<br/><br/>
<strong> HTML!! VS CSS!! </strong>
<br/><br/>

Using HTML allows for easy placement as it is a fluid image meaning that it can be resized with a couple of styling commands. Whereas CSS is the intent of using an image as a background, which can be achieved by inserting the location of the image into the stylesheet - this can only be done to set as a background. This changes the background a of a class, which changes the way you are styling as it's more the class and not the image. It is something that I have incorporated in my own learning as I have images within the CSS stylesheet for parallax scrolling and in the HTML document I have images to provide a visual explanation throughout my webpage.

<h4> Media in responsive webpages </h4>
<p>
In this week's lecture we looked over media in responsive webpages. The two main medias we looked at were video and image. We have already talked about images and the necessary aspects to consider when using them within a webpage. Now we’ll be taking a look at the use of videos within a webpage.  
</p>

<div class = "grid23">
<p>
When designing webpages, you are able to implement static videos that exist within their own container, meaning it will only play when clicked on and will stop once clicked on. It is functional and can be styled, due to it being fluid. The only problem with a video is that they can only be placed on a HTML document and not a CSS stylesheet. However, the styling of a video can still be altered using CSS styling. Listed to the right are some aspects that need to be taken into consideration regarding videos.
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong> Resolution of the video</Strong></li>
<li><strong> The size of the file </strong></li>

<h4> Week 7 laboratory work </h4>


<p>
This week’s laboratory task is to carry on styling elements and incorporate some images by using CSS. This means implementing some background images as well as demonstrating my ability to style images in both HTML and CSS. The overall task is test and experiement with how elements work when using flexible styling features such as max width and height. Another task is to wrap text around images which we have completed previously. The final task is optional, requiring us to add a video, personally I don’t think a video would best suit my page however, I will implement one to demonstrate my skill and understanding.

For my independent learning this week I searched online for ways I can could make my webpage responsive and looked at the recommended reading material for this week which was <a href=" https://alistapart.com/article/fluid-images/" target="_blank"> alistapart</a>.This site discussed how to make images fluid with the use of CSS. It gave exsamples of images as well as videos and how the browser resizes them. i will try to implement this into my own webpage itself , using min and max to prevent any resizing problems.

I found this week's content to be very helpful as I was able to identify and fix some image problems within my HTML document. The issue was that some of my images were overlapping text however, I overcame this problem by simply setting a min and max length to prevent any overlapping when changing the scale of my webpage, which can be seen within my webpage, this was discussed above in my independent learning.

<h2>Week 6: Introduction to
responsive web design </h2>

<h4> Introduction to responsive web design/development </h4>
<p>
Responsive web design is the process of designing websites/webpages that can render when used on a variety of devices. This means that the size of the screen is able to change when viewed on different platforms.
<br/><br/>
RWD was designed by Ethan Marcotte and is used widely by the majority, if not all, web developers. It is useful because people can access websites from a variety of different devices, RWD helps developers to scale their site to the ideal size for different platforms. Another aspect is cost effectiveness, it is cheaper for most businesses as they don’t have to create a second webpage for a different device. The main goal when using RWD is to make webpages easily accessible on multiple platforms.
</p>

</div>

<div class = "parallax5"></div> 
<div class = "information">
<h4>RWD – 3 core techniques   </h4>

<div class = "grid19">
<p>
This next section will be about the three main core techniques with responsive web design. The three techniques are as listed. 
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong> Fluid layout </Strong></li>
<li><strong> CSS media queries </Strong></li>
<li><strong>Responsive media </Strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
<strong>Fluid layout</strong>- This is the process of using units such as px or em to resize elements to the way you want it to be displayed on your webpage. This can also be done using some other CSS aspects such as grids and flexbox.
<br/><br/>
<strong>CSS media queries </strong>- These are aspects that modify the viewport size (which we discussed at an early week) and the change in screen width due to the platform used. This usually uses styling elements as they have different capabilities for most devices.
<br/><br/>
<strong> Responsive media </strong>- This is the process of making images flexible on different platforms, altering the size of an element briefly so that it does not distort. This is especially useful when scaling down on web browsers. 
</p>


</div>



<div class = "parallax5"></div> 
<div class = "information">
<h4> CSS3 media queries   </h4>
<p>
The focus of this section is media queries, this media type is implemented for features such as height, resolution and width. Media queries are able to match the media type of the device that the user is using. 
<br/><br/>
There are simple methods when using media queries, this method is designed to target the viewport method. This type is the <strong> @media </strong> query, when placed within the CSS style sheet it checks whether the media type of the device is able to access the web page.
</p>
<p>
The use of the <strong> @media </strong> to target different media types enables for easy functionality on different devices. This is an approach which most web developers use as it eliminates the uses of two style sheets for different platforms. This can be done by using a combination of min and max values.

<h4> Week 6 laboratory work </h4>
<p>
For this week’s laboratory task we are looking into applying workflow to our learning journals, which is the process of designing a layout using a grid format. The outcome should be that the presentation of the webpage isn't shown as a linear format which are essentially elements in a single row from top to bottom. The primary task is to use workflow to change the presentation of our webpage.
</p>

</div>


<div class = "parallax5"></div>

<h4> Independent learning </h4>
<p>
As part of my independent learning of week 6 I took it upon myself to incorporate a fluid layout within my webpage.However, before I did this I look at other webpages online to gain an insight of what sort of design I would like. I started implementing fluid layout in both in CSS and HTML to see which had a better outcome , I was able to resize images and listed elements. I did this so I could change my presentation of my webpage. I also made sure I used px to keep it consistent throughtout.

<h2>Week 5:CSS box model and measurements </h2>
<div class = "grid14">
<p>
We are now halfway through the semester at week five, in this week's lectures we are looking into CSS box models and the use of correct measurements. To the right is a list of what we will be covering in this week's lecture.
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong>CSS box model</strong></li>
<li><strong>CSS relative length units </Strong></li>

<div class = "information">
<h4> CSS box model </h4>
<div class = "grid15">
<p>
The lecture for week five began with a discussion about standard box models. Essentially a box model can be found within your source code on your webpage, it is designed to describe the format design of your webpage. The box model is made up of four different aspects which are listed to the right.
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong>Margin edge </strong></li>
<li><strong>Border edge </Strong></li>
<li><strong>Padding edge</Strong></li>
<li><strong>Content</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class = "grid16">
<p>
For example, if the box sizing is at default you can resize the design of the model to any size using a range of styling commands. To the lower right are some of the sizing and designs that can be applied to these edges.
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong> width </strong></li>
<li><strong> min-width </Strong></li>
<li><strong> max width </Strong></li>
<li><strong>   height</Strong></li>
<li><strong> min-height </Strong></li>
<li><strong> max-height </Strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
<div class = "parallax6"></div>
<div class = "information">
<h4> CSS relative length units </h4>
<div class = "grid17">
<p>
It is very important to consider which units of measurements you will use when styling images, text and design layout. The purpose of units is to define the distance of elements on your webpage. There are various amounts of units to use, here is a list located to the right of the measurement options you are able to use. 
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong> Absolute- fixed </strong></li>
<li><strong> in-inches </Strong></li>
<li><strong> cm-centimeters </strong></li>
<li><strong> mm-millimeters  </strong></li>
<li><strong>  pt-which is 1/72 of an inch </strong></li>
<li><strong> relative- another property </strong></li>
<li><strong> px-pixels </Strong></li>
<li><strong> %-percnetage </strong></li>
<li><strong> em-font size of elements </strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
When using measurements, you need to consider that there are different displays and devices to view webpages on. It is always important to test your webpage on multiple platforms and devices as this allows you to perfect the presentation on every device.

<h4> Week 5 laboratory work </h4>
<p>
Within this week’s laboratory work, we were styling more tags however, our main task was to specify a font-family. This simply requires styling font for test. We were tasked to look online at different websites to see their choice of style. Once we found a style that we deemed user friendly, we had the opportunity to apply this to our own text and see the font changes happen on our webpage.
<br/><br/>
Our next task was to see if we could wrap text around an image this was a process I found confusing at first however, watching a break down of this during the lecture made it more understandable and I have managed to successfully implement this aspect into my own work twice.

<h4> Independent learning </h4>
<p>
In week 5 of independent learning, we looked into measurements we use for different elements. We had the decision to decide what unit of size we had to use throughout our webpage. As part of my independent learning I did some research into which unit is commonly used, as well best to use. I was able to find out from various websites by looking in the source code (which wasn’t easy) to see the units they used. Majority used pixels and em’s for elements and text. Another aspect I noticed is that they most webpages kept the same unit throughout their stylesheet and document. I decided to use pixels through my web pages as its an easy unit of measurement to use when sizing elements and text. As well as units I was able to incorporate a colour-out line in my weekly titles that look something like the text below.I found this from <a href=" https://wpshout.com/quick-guides/create-text-outline-css/" target="_blank"> WPSHOUT</a>.

My opinion of this week’s lecture is that it was a useful start to researching how other websites style their text and whether this font-family changes or remains the same throughout their webpage. I also found learning how to wrap text around images useful as I have applied this to my own work, resulting in an improvement in my overall presentation.

<h2>Week 4:Cascading Style Sheets </h2>
<div class ="grid13">
<p>
Within this week’s lecture we are learning about introducing some styling designs to our learning journals. Week four will cover the following topics listed to the right.
</p>

<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong>What is CSS? </strong></li>
<li><strong>Selectors</Strong></li>

<div class = "information">
<h4> What is CSS? </h4>
<div class = "grid12">
<p> 
Cascading styles sheets are essentially a declarative language that allows users to style their webpages, which will be seen on browsers. With the development of CSS this allows for easy styling on HTML pages. Listed to the right are a handful of styling options that can be achieved using CSS.
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong>Border colour and size</strong></li>
<li><strong>Text colour and size</strong></li>
<li><strong>Background colour</strong></li>
<li><strong>Font style</strong></li>
<li><strong>Animations</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>
When using CSS there are some important aspects to consider such as:
<br/><br/>
The structure of the of content within the HTML document must be validated for errors as these can have a negative effect on certain styles. Another consideration is that CSS style sheets is separated from your HTML document this means that all styling can be easily changed or modified. Introducing CSS can help the user experience and accessibility of webpages making text clearer or bolder and better for those who have disorders or impaired sight.
 
</p>
</div>


<div class = "parallax7"></div>
<div class = "information">
<h4> Selectors </h4>
<p>
Within this section we will be discussing selectors. This is the use of a tag when styling. Therefore, when styling the CSS must match the HTML element. 
</p>
<p>
So, when styling &lt; p &gt; as a tag, the selector will be p. However, when stating a tag this might change the style of the tags you have already used.  To overcome this issue, you can implement a class attribute which will only style the specific stated class. There are four different types of selectors that can be used to help styling, these selectors are…
</p>
<div class="list2">
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong>Type selector </strong></li>
<li><strong>Class selector </strong></li>
<li><strong>ID selector </strong></li>
<li><strong>Pseudo-class selector</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>


<div class = "parallax7"></div>
<div class = "information">
<h4> Normalize.css </h4>
<p>
A normalized.css style sheet is a CSS file that makes browsers render all elements to current standards. Essentially this is a small CSS file which helps provide a more efficient cross browser consistency in default styling of HTML.
</p>
</div>


<div class = "parallax7"></div>
<div class = "information">
<h4> Week 4 laboratory work </h4>
<p>
For this week's lab lesson we had to create a style sheet and attach it to our HTML document, this can be done by inserting the creating file in the location of your stored webpages. In this case we saved our style sheet on file manager where we keep all our webpages and images. Once added you need to add a new line just below your viewport meta which is the location of your style sheet. This is done so that when the browser is loading it is able to find and use the style sheet to present your styled webpage. This is the line that needs to be added.
<br/>
<strong>&lt; link href="css/stylesheet.css" rel="stylesheet &gt;</strong>

<h4> Independent learning </h4>
<P>
   In week 4 of independent learning I looked into styling some of my webpage. I used <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/CSS/Styling_text/Fundamentals" target="_blank"> MDN web docs</a> to help start styling basic tags such as <strong>&lt; p &gt;</strong> to get an understanding of how it works. I managed to change the font style of text as by default, text is displayed in Arial unless told otherwise. I tried different types of fonts until I came across one I found perfect, which was <strong>“Courier”</strong>.I also learnt how to change the colour as well as add a bold effect on certain text.

<h4> Overall opinion of week 4 </h4>
<p>
    I found this week of web development especially interesting, as I have had a long standing curiousity regarding how websites manage to style and present their web pages on multiple devices and browsers. With the use of style sheets and CSS this has made it an easy task to implement within my own webpage. It is easy to use as it has a very straight forward language and shares many similarities with java. Overall I am very pleased to have the chance to start styling.

</ul>

<div class ="grid8">
<p>
HTML files should always start with the HTML5 doctype declaration which is <strong class="intext">&lt;!doctype html&gt; </strong>  the reason for this is that the declaration's job is to tell the browser that the document being rendered is a HTML document. This is the reason for its position as it needs to be the first thing the browser reads, it is the first tag to be executed. An example of this is located to the right, showing an image from my learning journal that shows the start of a document, I have underlined the doctype with a red pen. 
</p>
<figure>
<img src="images/doctype.jpg " alt="Doctype visual" class="image" >
</figure>
</div>
<p>
There are other types of mark-up tags that can be used to create a well formed structure within the <strong class="intext">&lt; body &gt;</strong>. Using the selection of mark-up tags we learned in previous lectures to structure our learning journals, this can consist of <strong class="intext">&lt; h1 &gt; </strong>, <strong class="intext">&lt; main &gt; and <strong class="intext">&lt; p &gt;</strong></strong>.
</p>
<div class="grid9">
<p>
HTML5 documents for websites use the <strong class="intext">&lt;! div html&gt; </strong> which means (division), allowing us to set classes for specific tags. It also allows us to group a combination of tags and style them all the same. 
<br/><br/>
There are two important key words that help identify elements and tags of a class and to identify unique elements when styling. These are listed as a class attribute and an ID attribute to the right.
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong >Class attribute - This is used to help identify elements / tags that are in the same class and have been repeated more than once throughout the web document. </strong></li>

<li><strong>ID attribute - Used to identify unique elements / tags that usually only occur once on the HTML document.  </strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<P>
The ideal object model for a HTML document should all be nested within each other, meaning that block elements should be neatly nested in inline elements. Within the lecture a perfect model example was displayed and can be seen below which best represents how a HTML document should look like.
</P>

<div class="grid10">
<img src="images/model.jpg " alt="Doctype visual" class="image" >


<p>
As you can see from the model the <strong class="intext">&lt; div id=”wrapper”  &gt; </strong> is holding all nested elements. As mentioned <strong class="intext">&lt; div id=”wrapper”  &gt; </strong> would be considered a unique attribute which means it is only used once within a HTML document which is correct within this model. You can also see that <strong class="intext">&lt; body &gt; </strong> is the highest ranked tag as all other tags are nested within, this means that styling <strong class="intext">&lt; body &gt; </strong> would style all un-classed tags.

<h4>Hypertext: navigating and organising content</h4>

<p>
Within this section we will be discussing the use of navigating content within a HTML document. Essentially HTML documents are already hypertext, as for every document made by a website this means that they can navigate from one content / page to another using links. 
<br/><br/>
<div class ="grid11">
<p>
In order to achieve navigation between pages or even different sections of a page itself, you will have to use anchors. This can be done by incorporating the <strong class="intext">&lt; a &gt; </strong> tag.
<br/><br/>
By using the <strong class="intext">&lt; a &gt; </strong> tag this allows you to anchor together two web pages with the use of a link. Anchors can be used for the following link points listed below.
</P>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong> Internal links – Which are anchors that are placed within the same webpage. </strong></li>

<li><strong> Local link – This is using an anchor to navigate between two or more web pages. </strong></li>

<li><strong> External links – These are anchors that connect to other websites such as shops or blogs.  </strong></li>

<li><strong> Email link – This is a link of an individual’s email address to provide quick access.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class =”navigation”>
<p>
 Next, we will be talking about the formation of anchors and links. This will break each part of an anchor down in order to explain what each part means as displayed below.
</P>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong> &lt;a&gt; –  This informs the browser to link between other pages or link points. </strong></li>

<li><strong> &lt;href attribute&gt; – This part of the tag is the reference, it essentially tells the browser where the destination to link is. </strong></li>

<li><strong> External links – These are anchors that connect to other websites such as shops or blogs.  </strong></li>

<li><strong> Text name – Is simply the name of where the link takes the user once clicked on. </strong></li>
</ul>

<p>
Overall a link can look like the example below, however, there are different forms of links where each one works the same but they all have different points of location.
</p>

<p class="navlink">
    <strong>&lt;a href="index.html">Home page &lt;/a &gt;</strong>
</p>

<h4>The viewport meta element</h4>
<p>
This next section is about how to present your web pages on different formats. This can mean testing your web pages on multiple devices / browsers as the overall appearance will change the format and layout of your web page depending on what device it is being viewed on. 
<br/><br/>
Within this section we will discuss how to resolve these issues as well as implement meta element which is beneficial when using your webpages on multiple platforms. 
</p>
<p>
The new element we had learnt was the viewport element which is essentially scaling your web page to the width of the browser. This simply means that if someone was to access your website on other smaller devices such as a smart phone then your webpage should remain the same size. The reason we do this is because we want our webpages to behave the same on every device as this means user experience doesn’t get affected. <br/><br/>
Below I will break down the meta element which looks like this &lt; meta name="viewport" content="width=devicewidth, initial-scale=1"/&gt; and explain what each part means and does.
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong> 
"width=device-width" – This part of the meta simply states that the width of the viewport in pixels must be the same as the screen width of the device. This part is the key aspect that makes different devices act the same.
</strong></li>

<li><strong> 
"initial-scale=1" – This end point of the meta is telling the browser to display the page when loading in full size. This replaces the scaling down feature. 
</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>

<h4>Week 3 laboratory work</h4>
<p>
For this weeks lab tutorial, we were simply working on more mark-up for our learning journals. This meant we had to introduce more tags such as inserting an image and making lists. Another task we had to do for this weeks lab was to introduce the viewport meta on our HTML document file.
   <br/><br/>
We also had to make sure that we were nesting our inline and block elements correctly. This was to prevent any errors when validating.

<h4>Independent learning</h4>
<P>
    The independent learning I did for week 3 was some reading about document and website structure from <a href=" https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/Document_and_website_structure" target="_blank"> MDN web docs</a>. It gave a detailed insight into structuring my document and what sections I could include. This has allowed me to plan and design what content I will include within my webpage. It’s an intresting page to read as it helps you to plan webpages as well as the approaches to achieving these goals. It uses good visual images which helped my understanding. I Applied a similar style in terms of sections but have redesigned the layout.
</P>

<h4>Overall opinion  of week 3</h4>
<p>
I felt that this week was beneficial as we learnt a new aspect which was the viewport meta. This is a very important meta element in regards to multi-platform viewing on other devices, it improves the user experience. The purpose for using this as mentioned earlier, is that it helps scale your webpage. I have recently introduced this meta into my web page and with this I have successfully fixed some issues that were occurring before such as when using the webpage on mobile devices there were inconsistencies with the layout and sizing that have since been remedied.

<h2>Week 2: HTML markup basics</h2>

<div class = "grid19">
<p>
This is the second week of web development where we will be looking at the basics of HTML mark-up as well as planning our independent learning journals. In this week's lecture we will be covering the following areas listed to the right.
</p>

<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong>HTML tags and elements</strong></li>
<li><strong>Block and inline elements</strong></li>
<li><strong>Well formed markup</Strong></li>

<h4>Introduction to week 2 and HTML tags and elements</h4>

<p>
To start off the second week's lecture we had a recap of basic web standards such as how it is not common practice to use presentation tags and that any styling should be done with CSS. We also discussed common tags that we will be using throughout the majority of our learning journal. 

The focus of week two involved learning new HTML syntax and terminology, the new tag we learned and brokedown was <strong class="intext">&lt;a&gt; href=”ci435/index.html”>Learning Journal&lt;/a&gt;</strong> below lists the four components that this tag is broken down into.
</p>
<div class="list1">
<ol class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong>&lt;a&gt; </strong> </li>

<li><strong> &lt;Href&gt;</strong> </li>

<li><strong>“mysite/index.html </strong> </li>

<li><strong> “learning journal”</strong> </li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class ="grid1">
<p>This tag can be broken down into four components. Starting with the front  <strong class="intext">&lt;a&gt;</strong>,this tag simply means an anchor, the purpose of this is to mark-up a file which can have images as well as links  from external online URL sites. The next is  <strong class="intext">&lt;Href&gt;</strong>, this simply is the hypertext reference of the anchor tag or in brief the attribute. The next component is the <strong class="intext">“mysite/index.html”</strong>, essentially this is the value of the attribute meaning that it provides a guide to the location of the file or the web link of the site. The final component is “learning journal” this the highlight name you wish to be display for the link. Altogether it will be called an element. The next tag we look at is <strong class="intext">&lt;!doctype html&gt;</strong> this is placed within the header and can only been seen within the source-code and it simply states what the document type is, in this case the document type will be in a HTML format. We also discussed why we use HTML instead of HTML5, HTML is stricter than that of HTML5, an example of this is loacted to the right.
</p>

<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong>Tags must be closed </strong></li>

<li><strong>Tags must be written in lower case</strong></li>

<li><strong>Attribute names must be in lowercase form</strong></li>

<li><strong>Attribute names must be nested in the correct quotation form</strong></li>
<li><strong>Elements must be nested correctly</strong></li>

</ul>
</div>
</div>


<div class = "parallax9"></div>
<div class = "information">

<h4>Block and inline elements</h4>
<div class="grid2">
<p>
   This next topic of discussion was block and inline elements. Both elements are different kinds of tags, they can be broken down into these two key points shown on the right.
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong>Block- Is any element that starts on a new line. An example of these are headings (&lt;h1&gt;), paragraphs (&lt;p&gt;) and lists (&lt;ol&gt;and&lt;ul&gt;).</strong></li>

<li><strong>Inline- These are elements that are found within blocks. An example of these are bold &lt;b&gt;.</strong></li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
When using block and inline elements there are some fundamental rules that need to be applied such as... 

<strong class="intext">block elements </strong><i> must contain a nested inline element as well as other block elements</i>.

<strong class="intext">Inline elements</strong><i> cannot contain block elements. This is due to the fact that block elements are considered a higher hatchery of tags compared to inline. This means that inline elements can only contain other inline elements and or content</i>.
</p>
</div>


<div class = "parallax9"></div>
<div class = "information">

<h4>Well formed markup</h4>
<p>
    This next section will explain the correct way to achieve a well-formed HTML.
    <br/><br/>
<strong class="intext">Well formed HTML</strong> = <strong class="intext">Elements nested correctly</strong><br/><br/>
When using block or inline elements these must be correctly nested. The term nested simply means placing the correct tag/ element in the correct order e.g. the block elements should sandwich the inline elements. <br/><br/>
When using HTML it is best to visualise elements as if they are contained within their own little box. An example of this is the body tag which is a block tag, meaning that inline tags have to be placed within the element.  Doing this is the correct way of achieving a well formed mark-up. However, this is just the simplest way, there are other ways that can be considered.
</p>
</div>


<div class = "parallax9"></div>
<div class = "information">

<h4>Week 2 laboratory work</h4>
<div class="grid3">
<p>
The lab tutorial task for this week was to make a start on our learning journal, this meant beginning to type some of the content that will be inside our journal. We had to use the correct mark up content based on what we had learnt from the lecture from week 2. Our main tasks are listed to the right and were to perform the following by the end of lab 2.
</p>

<ol class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong>Save the first web page as “Learning journal page”</strong></li>
<li><strong>Save the second web page as “Tutorial”</strong></li>
<li><strong>Save the third web page as “Contact” </strong></li>
<li><strong>Create a list </strong></li>
<li><strong>Create links to external websites </strong></li>
<li><strong>Use h1 and h2 tags </strong></li>
<li><strong>Validate HTML once finished adding some content </strong></li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>
The first of the three tasks was to change the name of the webpage, this was an easy and basic task to perform. All we had to do was use the Title tag to display the desire name. The result of this is when the user opens the web page it will display the name at the top in the tab, however in order for this action to work you have to place the Title tag in in the head element as this will keep it hidden. 
<br /><br />
The next task was to create a list, which can be done by using <strong class="intext">&lt;ol&gt;</strong> or <strong class="intext">&lt;ul&gt;</strong>. the difference between these two tags is that <strong class="intext">&lt;ol&gt;</strong> displays the content within a  numbered ordered list whereas <strong class="intext">&lt;ul&gt;</strong> displays the content in a bullet point list. 
<br /><br />
The next task was to create navigations on the page using anchors. Essentially anchors are page markers which allow the user to quickly jump to different segments of the web page. This is effective as it reduces the amount of scrolling and looking when a user is trying to find a specific piece of information. For this example I explain how to create an anchor that will take you to the top of the web page, in-order to create an anchor for your web page you will need type the following lines at the top of the web page <strong class="intext">&lt; div id=”wrapper” &gt;</strong> and <strong class="intext">&lt; a id=”top” &gt;</strong>. From there you will need to create a link and place it just before the footer <strong class="intext">&lt;  a href="#top">Go to top &gt; </strong> it is important to notice that the ID of the name is included within the anchor destination. To see if the anchor works simply click the link to see if it takes you to the top, if it does then you have successfully created an anchor.
<br /><br />
The next task we are doing is inserting an image. There are two ways of doing this, the first being using an image from a website / online or the second option is that you can save an image as a .png. However, the primary function of using an image is to provide visual help and understanding. First you need to create a block element to hold the image this can be <strong class="intext">&lt;figure&gt;</strong> tag. Next you want to include <strong>&lt;  img src="images/image.png" alt=" "&gt;</strong>. To understand this tag it is easiest if you break it down into three sections, firstly we would have the <strong class="intext">img src</strong> which is simply stating that you are getting an image. The second is <strong class="intext">="images/image.png" </strong> this can vary per person as different people may wish to store the .png in a different location or rename the .png. However, this part is stating the location of the image so this would tell us that the photo is stored within “image.png”. The final part is <strong class="intext">alt=“”</strong> this simply allows the user to name the image resulting in that chosen name being displayed when the cursor is hovering over the image.
<br /><br />
The final task for this week is to validate your HTML. This step is important as it will help in the future when styling however, in general it is always best to have a well formed mark-up to begin with. When designing your webpage it is always a good habit to validate your webpage by simply using this <a href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C-Markup validation service</a> to check your work. To use it simply place the link for your webpage in the search bar, it will process your webpage and identify any errors or warnings that need fixing.

<h4>Independent  learning</h4>
<p>
    This weeks independent learning for week 2 was looking on <a href=" https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_basic.asp " target="_blank"> W3School.com </a> to gain a more in-depth look into the mark-up tags that we have learnt in week 2 lecture's. I also learnt new additional tags to be used on my webpage. I looked into HTML lists and the different styles you can apply to them. I manage to implement and use both list’s in week one and two. I also had the ability to learn how to create a button which can been seen below (Does nothing),however is as simple as using the <strong class="intext">&lt; Button &gt;</strong> tag.

<h4>Overall opinion  of week 2</h4>
<p>
    I found this week's content to be very interesting and useful to the development of my webpage. I have learnt new tags that I can now implement in my own work and begin introducing more content in different styles, overall this week's lab was a simple but effective addition to my pre-existing knowledge of the topic.

Our first web development lecture of semster one began with an introduction to our lecturers. The main purpose of the first lecture is to discuss how the semester will function and providing necessary information regarding the course such as a teaching plan which is located to the right which can also be found on student central.

<br/><br/>
    The purpose of the teaching plan is to break down how semester one will run and what topics to expect. My personal opinion of this is that introducing a schedule that is easily accessable to the students is a helpful and effective way to keep up to date with current work. It also allows students to be prepared with the upcoming topics within the module.

<h4>Semester one coursework</h4>
<p>
    The coursework we are being given for semester one is worth 50% of the module marks and it entitles you to create a 3 page responsive website, which is written in <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?ei=DdymXbXtKquEhbIP6_2VGA&q=html&oq=html&gs_l=psy-ab.3..0i131i273j0i273j0i67l2j0l5j0i131.108616.109021..109204...0.6..0.74.212.4......0....1..gws-wiz.......0i71j0i10.tRhGwrXH34g&ved=0ahUKEwj1p4CataDlAhUrQkEAHet-BQMQ4dUDCAo&uact=5" target ="_blank">HTML</a> and styled with <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?ei=e9ymXdD0KbG78gKAkauQBA&q=css&oq=CSS&gs_l=psy-ab.1.0.0i67l10.57716.58715..59565...0.1..0.44.123.3......0....1..gws-wiz.....0..0i71j0i131j0.qSD5ymv1ipM" target=" _ blank">CSS</a> <!--this is a blank link which essentaily means that when clicked on it will direct you to the external web source on a new tab-->

Essentially, we will record every topic for the first semester and write it up whilst providing my opinion and how I felt about that week’s topic. Semester one’s course work is likely to be interesting and entertaining due to the fact that we are able to be creative with the use of two languages HTML and CSS. We will be using HTML which stands for Hypertext Mark-up Language, this is the standard mark-up that is typically used by most sites on the internet. CSS was chosen as it can easily assist HTML with the styling of the web page as it possesses many functions and useful tools.

<h4>Learning resources</h4>
<p>
   This section was briefly implemented and the sole purpose of this was to uncover different sources of revision for both experienced and beginning web developers. Throughout this part of the lecture we discussed the best possible resources to help us with the course. A reading list was suggested which can be found at student central from this location <a href="https://rl.talis.com/3/brighton/lists/FEDAF8FA-63A2-C063-00C5-718E08E81F0D.html "  target="_blank">Reading list</a>. Our lecturer recommended a book called Html & CSS: Design and build websites by Jon Duckett. I purchased a copy for myself off of amazon which also is linked at this location <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=Htm%2F+%26+CSS%3A+Design+and+build+websites&qid=1571761980&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzM0ZVSTE2T0NTWjkxJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjUxMzM2UTBJSEtLQjdCOVVFJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2NjUyMTAxNjJNMEswMzBIWkgxJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ== " target ="_blank">HTML and CSS text book amazon</a>. This book is a good way for beginners to develop an understanding of basic tags and the correct layout. From reading the book myself, I feel that it is perfect for less experienced web designers as it's laid out clearly, explaining different tags and elements in simple and straight forward sentences.

Within this section we discussed the fundamentals of a HTML document and the standards with compliant HTML documents. We discussed what certain tags meant such as "!doctype html" and went through how it would effect the document. A visulation of this discussion from the lecture has been attached to the right to provide a better understanding of the topic.<br/><br/>
   As well as a basic explanation of tags our lecturer also discussed web standards, which went something like this. The first part was specifying the syntax for the mark up language, because we are using HTML it will be based on that language. This can been seen below.
</p>
<p class="clear">
    
</p>


<ol class = "OrderedLists">

<li><strong>Syntax – Is the grammar / format used with specific rules.  In terms of HTML, tags are lowercase, most tags are closed with &lt; tagID &gt; and are applied like you would with grammar rules.</strong> </li>
<li><strong>Semantics – Is having many meanings that are the same idea. An example of this would be bold text you can use both strong and bold tags which do the same as each other, however tags are marked up in a meaningful way ie &lt;p&gt; means a paragraph of text.</strong></li>

</ol>
<div class ="grid5">
<p>
   Along with web standards we also discussed separation of content which essentially means the overall structure of tags that make styling changes to certain aspects of the web page using HTML. Some examples of this includes the centre text tag <strong class="intext">&lt;center&gt;</strong>, underline tag <strong class="intext">&lt;u&gt;</strong>.  However, even though we don’t use these tags anymore they are still recognised by certain HTML standards. These tags would be considered as styling tags and can become a problem when you use CSS stylesheets as it may clash and cause issues. <br /><br />
   Finally, to finish off this section we discussed alternative tools that can be used to write HTML on. These tools are listed to the right and are both free open source text editors. To know a bit more about them you can click on the buttons to the right which will direct you to more information.

<h4>Laboratory work</h4>
<div class = "grid6">
<p>
Within the last section of this week’s lecture we went through the process of how laboratory work will proceed as well locating areas where we are able to access <a href="https://brighton.domains/" target="_blank">brighton.domains</a>. Brighton domains is an online web server that provides all our resources and applications to design web pages as well as providing access to other features for different modules. We were also given the task of setting up files for our work to be saved in, we had to create a separate folder which would hold our three web pages. This task was very simple and beneficial as it allowed us to gain a better understanding of how to manage and where to save work. As a recap from this lab tutorial we managed to perform the following to the right.
</p>
<ul class = "OrderedLists">
<li><strong>How to access our Brighton domains files</strong></li>
<li><strong>We learnt where and how to place files</strong></li>
<li><strong>We also created the necessary folders we needed for our learning journal</strong></li>
<li><strong> We learnt how to create the HTML files we were working on which are the three pages of our course work </strong></li>
<li><strong>Have three files named "index.html", "tutorial.html" and "Contact"</strong></li>
</ul>

<h4>Independent learning</h4>
<p>
The independent learning I did for week 1 was taking a look at the reading materials for this module, I found a book that I have previously mentioned within this week's notes that you can find on amazon called <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/HTML-CSS-Design-Build-Websites/dp/1118008189/ref=sr_1_2_sspa?keywords=Htm%2F+%26+CSS%3A+Design+and+build+websites&qid=1571761980&sr=8-2-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzM0ZVSTE2T0NTWjkxJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNjUxMzM2UTBJSEtLQjdCOVVFJmVuY3J5cHRlZEFkSWQ9QTA2NjUyMTAxNjJNMEswMzBIWkgxJndpZGdldE5hbWU9c3BfYXRmJmFjdGlvbj1jbGlja1JlZGlyZWN0JmRvTm90TG9nQ2xpY2s9dHJ1ZQ== " target ="_blank"> HTML and CSS</a>. I have found this book useful as it has improved my knowledge regarding the basic structure/layout of my webpage as well as essential tags that I will be using within my webpage, how to nest these tags and key areas to consider when starting.

<h4>Overall opinion of week one</h4>
<p>
My general thoughts regarding this week’s lecture was that it was very informative and beneficial as it answered some questions that I was unsure of. These questions included, wondering what does this module entail? How do we get access to online servers? What’s the best resource to use that will help me? What are the most beneficial methods and techniques? After exiting that lecture I am much more confident in my ability to answer each one of those questions.</p>
